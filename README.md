##The story behind

While learning and using different technologies I make [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) for personal use. They help me better learn, remember new information and understand the major structure and fundamentals of a technology.

Why not share and collaborate?

## Main goal
To provide an open and free set of mind maps, allowing easier learning, using and faster making solutions with different information technologies .

A single or several mind maps on each technology can represent:

* The structure of technology. Main ideas, goals and solutions.
* Learning resources and learning route. In what order to learn various aspects and how to improve the [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve).
* Solution map. I am in state A. What do I do to reach state B?

## The solution

* Mind maps are published in a GitHub repository. There is a similar repository, gathering [links to free programming books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books). 
* Participants, proficient in different technologies collaborate to create and improve mindmaps.

## Open questions


* How to make a tool for making solutions, and not just another reference?
* Which tool to use for viewing and editing mind maps? The criteria are:
	* Free and preferrably opensource
	* Works on all platforms
	* Able to open documents in a single action (e.g. opening a URL).
	* Able to separate structure from strings for localization.
	* Text (non-binary) format, enabling the use of [diff utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility). 
	* Able to attach images and links to map nodes.
* Mind maps are essentially a representation of one's mind (or a collective mind). They are prone to subjectivity, opinions and disagreements. A strong contribution policy is required to prevent that.


## Possible tools for working with mind maps

I'm currently considering the following solutions:

* One of opensource office suites, maps in [OpenDocument-graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument#Specifications) format. Can be mirrored on Google Docs. Can be saved for offline use. Exported to pdf and, probably, other formats. Reach abilities.
	* [Apache OpenOffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_OpenOffice)
	* [LibreOffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice) 

* [Mindmaps by David Richard](http://drichard.org/mindmaps/#): opensource, Javascript. Launches in a browser, works with cloud storages (maps can be mirrored on Google Docs). Has limited abilities in editing mind maps. Easier to learn and use.

* [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/): opensource, Java. Works on all desktops, doesn't work in a browser. Has richer abilities (are they required?)




## Next objectives

1. Publish mind maps for Git in drichard-mindmaps format.
2. Test collaboration
3. Publish in a couple of possible ways.
